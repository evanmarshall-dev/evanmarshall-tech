Two clients. Two problems solved. Two 5-star reviews. 🌟🌟

One needed WiFi that could reach his new garage (challenge accepted ✅).
The other needed her computer cleaned up, her printer working, AND to stop
paying for antivirus software she didn't need — saving her hundreds of dollars. 💸

That's what Evan Marshall Tech Services is about: solving real problems,
saving you money, and actually explaining what's going on.

If I've helped you out, I'd love a Google review — it means the world
to a small local business: 👇

And if you know someone who could use honest, no-nonsense tech help
in the Valley — share this post. You might just save them a trip to Geek Squad. 😄
